\chapter{Software Requirements}
\section{Intially}
\subsection{Data Transmission}
It has to be clear when a transmission takes place and which data it contains. The user who is getting tracked must be recorded for the \gls{db} too.
\subsection{Data Design}
Also the information about the users have to be stored in the \gls{db}. Furthermore, a list of features has to be defined and integrated. This serves to adapting extensions of products from the competitive analysis.
\subsection{Webserver}
The webserver is provided and maintained by the company Sunlime IT Services. The server is located in a data center in Vienna and is tethered with 10\gls{gbitps}.
\section{Additional Requirements}
\subsection{\gls{rest}}
We switched to the technology \gls{rest} to save data in the \gls{db}. Our \gls{rest} Server is written in \gls{php} and uploads data.
\subsection{MySQL Database}
Since our partner companies main products are homepages, they already had a running \gls{mysql} \gls{db}. So they created a new workspace for us, which we could use.
