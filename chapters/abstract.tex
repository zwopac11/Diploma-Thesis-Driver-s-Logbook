Every day people drive to work in their own, or their company's car. In order to get tax refunds, the company has to keep careful records of the driven kilometers. This procedure takes a lot of time,  especially when the recording is done manually. Therefore our partner company suggested to automatically collect the needed data on an external device.\newline

Our project consists of a device placed in the car. This hardware consists of a \gls{rpi2} and a \gls{gps} module. It tracks the driven distances and computes a total of the kilometers. This information is inserted into a \gls{db}. If there is no internet connection while the car is in motion, the data are saved on the device and uploaded as soon as possible once there is an internet connection available. Afterwards, the user can log into his user account on our website or mobile application to see the driven tracks. The user also can enter routes manually using the app or through the website. The software provides for a separation between private and business usage of the car. A possibility to edit the tracked ways is also given. It's also possible to view it on the phone or tablet via a mobile application.\newline

In summary, we have developed a system consisting of hardware and software to log tracks via \gls{gps} data while driving.
