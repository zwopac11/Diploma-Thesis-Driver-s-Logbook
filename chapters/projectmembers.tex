\section*{Paul Zwölfer}
Paul's responsibility was the programming of the software for the working prototype. He provided a lot of technical information on software, modules and the different APIs. Due to his engagement and never ending ambition, the development of the software went very well.

Together with Claudio, he started to test the software right from the first working state. This helped to avoid problems and provide a well conceived programme structure.
