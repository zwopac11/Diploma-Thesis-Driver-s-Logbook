\section*{Helena Adam}
Helena took over the task of the team leader of this project. She was our connection person to our two supervising teachers Mr. DI Dr. Wolfgang Pölzleitner and Mr. Florian Schreiber, and our partner company Sunlime IT Services. Since she had already worked there for an internship, she had great connections to the employees.

She managed the task of comparing competitive products we worked on together. Additionally, she documented held meetings and guided the project management in general.

\section*{Claudio Knapp}
Our hardware expert Claudio cared about our hardware prototype, the \gls{rpi2}. He was involved in the analysis of competing products and researched on what modules to buy. After he found out how we could install them properly, he got to the work.

These added modules were for example the GPS module, UPS or the antenna . With his enthusiastic way, working on the thesis has never been boring.

\section*{Laura Rössl}
The role of the database expert was taken over by Laura, who set up and maintained our database structure. She kept up with all the software construction changes and therefore updated the \gls{erd} in the required way. Laura also designed other diagrams such as the software diagrams or the use case diagrams. 

She was also participated in the research on different competitors and analyzing the demand of the market.

Moreover, she did a great job creating the wireframing with the tool balsamiq. This was essential for the future organization of the user interface.

\section*{Paul Zwölfer}
Paul's responsibility was the programming of the software for the working prototype. He provided a lot of technical information about the software, modules and the different APIs. Due to his engagement and never ending ambition, the development of the software went very well.

He also contributed documentation of competitors and supported Laura with designing the wireframing and maintain the \gls{db}.

Together with Claudio, he started to test the software right from the first working state. This helped to avoid problems and provided a well conceived program structure.
