Our hardware expert Claudio cared about our hardware prototype, the \gls{rpi2}. He also appended additional modules that were required such as...\textit{\textbf{(wasn alles..?)}} . He researched on what modules to buy and how we could install them properly.

\section*{Laura Rössl}
The role of the database expert was taken over by Laura, who set up and maintained our database structure. She kept up with all the software structure changes and therefore changed the \gls{erd} on what we arranged beforehand. Laura also designed other diagrams such as the software diagrams or the use case diagrams. \textit{\textbf{(vll noch was mit wireframing/balsamiq..?)}}

\section*{Paul Zwölfer}
Paul's responsibility was the programming of the software for the working prototype. He provided a lot of technical information on software, modules and the different APIs. Due to his engagement and never ending ambition, the development of the software went very well.

Together with Claudio, he started to test the software right from the first working state. This helped to avoid problems and provide a well conceived programme structure.
