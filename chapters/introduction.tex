\section*{Role of the Company}
In this part of our diploma-thesis it is listed up what our employer, Sunlime IT Services, contributes to the work of the electronic logbook, which includes following areas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware
\item Data transfer
\item Design requirements
\item Content requirements
\end{itemize}
The company provides the RPi2 with all the components like GPS Module or antenna to create a working hardware prototype for the logbook.

Secondly, at the data transfer, they will define when and over which portal the data has to be sent. Moreover, it should be apparent which user is transferring the data, so it can be dedicated online. It is also important to consider the user data when designing the database. Furthermore, a feature list has to be defined and integrated.
The web server for the portal is also provided and maintained from the company.
\newline \newline
An external service provider creates the design from the existing wireframing and Sunlime IT Services implements the technical aspects to it. The external service provider should also design a Logo, which will be shown in the web portal.

Thirdly, the company has to choose a “Mobile-first” approach to react to the width of each end device.

Then, the logbook should also work on smartphones. Therefore, Adobe PhoneGap should help to transact the program. The mobile application has to be designed one time only.
\newline \newline
Finally, the company is responsible for the security on the servers. It should not be possible to have access on a server as third person. Passwords are only allowed to get saved encrypted.

\section*{Goals}
The goal of our diploma-thesis is to build a working hardware prototype, which records GPS data. A RPi2 with a GPS module, has to be put into a car, to track GPS data and transfers it to a REST (Representational State Transfer) interface. REST is responsible for uploading data into the database. Due to the fact that we need to upload the GPS data into our database, we have to store the data locally on the RPi2 if there is no internet connection. The program structure is described in our Software description section.
\newline \newline
For our partner company, information about the user and for the user the tracks have to be stored in the database. To illustrate the structure of the databases, an Entity-Relationship diagram (ER Diagram) got created and designed. Furthermore, the Data Definition Language (DDL) and the Data Manipulation Language (DML) resulted out of the ER diagram.
\newline \newline
The wireframing is the Front-End representation of our diploma thesis. It displays the user interface on our web portal and mobile application. A user-friendly design is the result of our wireframing.
\newline \newline
To get a unique product, the market needs to get analysed. Here, the competitors should get detected and compared in different attributes. For instance: costs, supported platforms, GPS, hardware etc. With this information, a diploma-thesis should be created which differs from other products. Furthermore, other intended uses of the hardware prototype should get noted down.
\newline \newline
Last but not least, the project management of the working packets has to be defined appropriate and documented.
