\section{Smartphone}
The design for the smartphone consists of four different pages. 
\subsection{Login}
The login dialogue is the first page you see. There are two input fields; for the username and the password. Below these input fields there is the login button to confirm and login. Then there is a check box to stay logged in.

The link if the password has been forgotten and a button to register and create a new user account are the last things on this page.
\subsection{Menu}
The menu pops up from the left edge as you can see on the picture down below. It can be chosen between viewing the tracks, customize settings, view statistics and logout.
\subsection{Tracks}
On the tracks page a map shows the last track by default but on the bottom any available track can be chosen to view it.
\subsection{Settings}
Under settings, basically changes like edit the mail address or change the password of the account can be applied, but also if the default track type should be private or public.
\subsection{Statistics}
It’s possible to view a graph where information of driven tracks are shown. Every registered car of this account can be chosen to view its graph and additionally, it’s selectable if the displayed data was tracked within the last week, month or year.

\section{Tablet}
The wireframing we created for the Tablet design is nearly similar to the smartphone design. Except of a few extensions, such as for renaming the device and editing tracks more precisely.
\subsection{Login}
The login dialogue is the first page you see. There are two input fields for the username and the password. Below these input fields there is the login button to confirm. Then there is a check box to stay logged in.
The link if the password has been forgotten and a button to register and create a new user account are the last things on this page.
\subsection{Menu}
The menu pops up from the left edge as you can see on the picture. It can be chosen between viewing the tracks, customizing settings, viewing statistics, renaming the device, registering a car and a logout.
\subsection{Tracks}
On the tracks page a map shows the last track by default. A track can be selected and there is the option to edit or merge a route.
\subsection{Settings}
Under settings, basic changes like editing the mail address or changing the password of the account can be applied, but also if the default track type should be private or public.
\subsection{Renaming Devices}
The \gls{rpi2} gets a random identification name from the start. It is possible edit this name if the user wishes so.
\subsection{Registering Car}
Over the account settings, it is possible to registrate a new car with your licence.
\subsection{Statistics}
It’s possible to view a graph where information of driven tracks is shown. Every registered car of this account can be chosen to view its graph and additionally, it’s selectable if the displayed data was tracked within the last week, month or year.

\section{Web Portal}
\subsection{Home}
Before the user is logged in, information about the product is shown on this page.

After the login, all tracks are shown and it is possible to change the tracks from private to public.
\subsection{Login}
The login dialogue is the first page you see. There are two input fields for the username and the password. Below these input fields there is the login button to confirm and login. Then there is a check box to stay logged in.
The link if the password has been forgotten and a button to register and create a new user account are the last things on this page.
\subsection{Settings}
Under settings, basic changes like editing the mail address or changing the password of the account can be applied, but also if the default track type should be private or public.
\subsubsection{Registering Car}
Over the account settings, it is possible to registrate a new car with your licence.
\subsubsection{Renaming Device}
The \gls{rpi2} gets a random identification name from the start. It is possible edit this name if the user wishes so.
\subsection{Track}
On the tracks page a map shows the last track by default. It can be chosen between the cars and the tracks of the respective cars can be viewed.
\subsubsection{Edit}
If a track is selected, there is the possibility of editing it. If the route isn’t complete or must be changed in any way, it can be done over the web portal. Should it happen that one track is splitted up into two or more tracks because of complications, you can merge them into one whole route.
\subsubsection{Create}
Here a new track can be created manually over the web portal and the route of the track can be chosen. It’s possible to set the start and end position of the new track and changing the route by pulling the line to the desired way.
\subsection{Statistics}
It’s possible to view a graph where information of driven tracks are shown. Every registered car of this account can be chosen to view its graph and additionally, it’s selectable if the displayed data was tracked within the last week, month or year.
\subsection{Menu}
The menu from the homepage contain home, tracks, statistics, settings and login. The menu item tracks contains subitems called edit and create. The subitems of settings are register car and rename device.
