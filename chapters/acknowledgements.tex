\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
We want to thank a lot of people. On the one hand, those people, who even made it possible for us to attend the \gls{htbla} Kaindorf. On the other hand, those who contributed valuable help to create a successful diploma-thesis.

A thank goes to all employees of our diploma-thesis company, Sunlime IT Services, who supported us in our work. However, a special thanks goes to our employer DI Dominik Fuchshofer, who gave us the chance to do our diploma-thesis with his company. As contact person he always stood at our side whenever we needed assistance. Without his tireless input, patient and understanding it would not have been possible to successfully complete the diploma-thesis.

Furthermore, we would like to thank DI Dr. Wolfgang Pölzleitner and DI Florian Schreiber, who took over the role of our supervisor teachers. If we had problems or other blockades, they always were there to help us finding a solution and make the best out of it. Through their cheerful character and their great interest in our work, we had good times at our meetings with them together.

Then, we want to thank our head teacher Mrs. Mag. Michaela Primig, who supported us the last past years. Sometimes we were not that easy, but she has never lost hope that we could not manage anything we want to do.

Last but not least, our deep thankfulness needs to be expressed to our parents. They supported us during our \gls{htbla} carrier as well the last past five years and gave us motivation whenever we needed one. Anyway, a special thanks goes to Paul’s dad, who helped us a lot with our diploma-thesis.
