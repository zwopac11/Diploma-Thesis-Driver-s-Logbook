\chapter{Optional Uses}
\pageauthor{Laura RÃ¶ssl}
The basic concept of our product was to track driven distances of a car you use for private and business purposes. Nevertheless, we thought about other possible uses for this product.
\section{Taxi}
One of our ideas for optional uses was for a taxi company. Our product could be placed in the taxi, the taxi driver presses a button if a new customer enters the car and the device calculates the price of the taxi ride based on the distance, the velocity and the fix basic costs. 
\section{Car Renting}
A car renting company usually gets paid for renting their cars per day. Our product could help them to control the use of their cars. Our product could track the distances the customer took so the company could calculate a suitable price. 
\section{Train Controller}
We thought about the optional use as a train controller for checking the current location of a train, check for complications and preventing delays. It would be also possible planning ahead to avoid incidents and more delays.
\section{Mowing Machine}
There are already mowing machines that can drive around in your garden on their own and they are already able to discover the shape of your ground. Using our product, you could extend the conventional device so you can choose between predetermined tracks that your mowing machine could take. It would also be possible to control your mowing machine over a mobile application to change the direction or stop mowing.
\section{Helicopter}
Another optional use for our product could be a controlling device for a helicopter. Choosing a flying track or checking the position and the track of the helicopter could be possible.
\section{Pet Tracking}
Another possibility for our product is to power the device with an battery pack and use it to track your pet. For example if you have a dog or a cat, you can put it on their collar for example and watch where it is and where it goes.
